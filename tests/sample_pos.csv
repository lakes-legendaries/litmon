0,"Age-related nuclear cataracts involve denaturation and aggregation of intracellular proteins. We have documented age-dependent changes in membrane transport in the mouse lens to see what might initiate changes in the intracellular milieu.
Microelectrode-based intracellular impedance studies of intact lenses were used to determine gap junction coupling conductance, fiber and surface cell membrane conductances, effective extracellular resistivity, and intracellular voltage. Fiber cell connexin expression was detected by Western blotting. Intracellular hydrostatic pressure was measured with a microelectrode/manometer system. Concentrations of intracellular sodium and calcium were measured by intracellular injection of sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate and Fura2, respectively.
In adult lenses, as age increased: fiber cell gap junction coupling conductance declined significantly, correlating with decreases in Cx46 and Cx50 labeling in Western blots; fiber and surface cell membrane conductances did not change systematically; effective extracellular resistivity increased monotonically; center to surface gradients for intracellular pressure, sodium, calcium, and voltage all increased, but in an interdependent manner that moderated changes. In newborn pup lenses, there were changes that did not simply fit with the above paradigm.
In newborn pup lenses, the observed changes may relate to growth factors that are not related to age-dependent changes seen in adult lenses. The major change in adult lenses was an age-dependent decrease in gap junction coupling, probably due to oxidative damage leading to degradation of connexin proteins. These changes clearly lead to compromise of intracellular homeostasis and may be a causal factor in age-related nuclear cataracts.","[{'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Junyuan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology & Biophysics, SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Huan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Xiurong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Varadaraj', 'firstname': 'Kulandaiappan', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Leping', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'White', 'firstname': 'Thomas W', 'initials': 'TW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mathias', 'firstname': 'Richard T', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1167/iovs.13-12593,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,"['gap junction coupling conductance', 'intracellular calcium concentration', 'intracellular hydrostatic pressure', 'intracellular sodium concentration', 'lens size', 'membrane conductance', 'membrane water permeability', 'resting voltage']",,2013-09-26,"24065810

1,"Ageing and diabetes share a common deleterious phenomenon, the formation of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs), which accumulate predominantly in collagen due to its low turnover. Though the general picture of glycation has been identified, the detailed knowledge of which collagen amino acids are involved in AGEs is still missing. In this work we use an atomistic model of a collagen fibril to pinpoint, for the first time, the precise location of amino acids involved in the most relevant AGE, glucosepane. The results show that there are 14 specific lysine-arginine pairs that, due to their relative position and configuration, are likely to form glucosepane. We find that several residues involved in AGE crosslinks are within key collagen domains, such as binding sites for integrins, proteoglycans and collagenase, hence providing molecular-level explanations of previous experimental results showing decreased collagen affinity for key molecules. Altogether, these findings reveal the molecular mechanism by which glycation affects the biological properties of collagen tissues, which in turn contribute to age- and diabetes-related pathological states.
