LITMON: Literature Monitoring Project
#####################################

For the Methuselah Foundation

This project monitors the scientific literature to identify articles related to
the mission of the Methuselah Foundation. It then provides those articles to
the foundation's leadership to make them aware of new and emerging research in
the field of longevity.

To get started, check out the `docs <https://lakes-legendaries.github.io/litmon/>`_!

Results from running this algorithm are posted on our `Azure cloud
<https://mfoundation.blob.core.windows.net/litmon/directory.html>`_.
