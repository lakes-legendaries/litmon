#. All code should be error-free via :code:`flake8` linting.

#. Where applicable, use :code:`pytest`-compliant unit tests.

#. Documentation is automatically built through GitHub Actions, published to
   the :code:`docs` branch to keep the :code:`main` branch light.

   To test documentation, run :code:`docsrc/build`.

   Do NOT check in documentation to your branch.

#. The version number is automatically updated through GitHub Actions on each
   push to main. With each update, the main branch is tagged with the version
   number.

#. Pull requests are welcome.
